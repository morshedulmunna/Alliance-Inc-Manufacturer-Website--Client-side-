        A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that
        can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages,
        that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated
        part of the definition is important. In his book "Working Effectively
        with Legacy Code", author Michael Feathers states that such tests are
        not unit tests when they rely on external systems: â€œIf it talks to the
        database, it talks across the network, it touches the file system, it
        requires system configuration, or it can't be run at the same time as
        any other test."
        <br /> <br />
        Modern versions of unit testing can be found in frameworks like JUnit,
        or testing tools like TestComplete. Look a little further and you will
        find SUnit, the mother of all unit testing frameworks created by Kent
        Beck, and a reference in chapter 5 of The Art of Software Testing .
        Before that, it's mostly a mystery. I asked Jerry Weinberg about his
        experiences with unit testing -- "We did unit testing in 1956. As far as
        I knew, it was always done, as long as there were computers".
        <br /> <br />
        Regardless of when and where unit testing began, one thing is for sure.
        Unit testing is here to stay. Let's look at some more practical aspects
        of unit testing.
